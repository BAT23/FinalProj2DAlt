Sprites:
Various itch.io creators: szadi art (Tiles and background), oco (Character), Jesse Munguia (Skeleton)
With some modifications for the character (was originally an archer)

Playtest 1:
At that point movement was essentially just the Mario style jumping and basic movement. Mostly sprite work done by that point. Playtester was a little iffy about the landing animation, so I shortened that later. Said jump hold and heights felt really good.

Playtest 2:
This one was a tad bit more fleshed out. Character had axe throwing by that point. Really liked how fluid the movement felt, dash was excellent as well as spin dash. Was a little confused by the axe getting stuck on things but overall not horribly peeved. Seemed to like it overall.
